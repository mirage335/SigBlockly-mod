SigBlocklyMod

Automatic integration of SigBlockly modifications over upstream Blockly repository, adding minimal support for C, Bash, and other languages.

# Maintenance
Custom blocks and code generators used to minimally support C, Bash, and other languages, are kept under _lib/modules .

# Generators
Language generators have been created by copying an existing generator, and replacing references to the name of the existing language, with the name of the new language.

Previously implemented over blockly commit 7679d227df8f62a12316334ee708d4a9a800ef17 .
